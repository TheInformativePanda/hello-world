# hello-world
This is my repository for my first file on Github titled hello-world.
I have dabbled in different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Java, and C++. I have always ended up slowly distancing myself from programming and it is something that I really want to learn so hopefully Github will be able to help me with it.
The first step was making an account and completing the hello-world tutorial so look where I am. I have finished both of those!
